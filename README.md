# About Me
> Hello! I'm **Natasha Y. Dungca**, a first-year student studying Information Systems. I'm just starting my journey in the world of programming and technology, but so far, I’ve gained a solid understanding of C language and Python.
I’m passionate about learning and improving my skills, and I’m currently exploring more about programming and how information systems work. I’m excited to continue building my knowledge and working on small projects as I grow in this field. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me if you’d like to collaborate or share ideas!!
